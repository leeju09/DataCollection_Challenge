# DataCollection_Challenge

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

# Skills Demonstrated in this challenge:

- Identifying HTML elements and using them to parse HTML using Beautiful Soup.
- Populating Python dictionaries and lists with scraped data (article titles and text previews).
- Looping through scraped data and storing the data into Python dictionaries and lists.
- Creating DataFrames, and bar charts
- Exporting scraped data CSV and JSON files.

# Analyze dataset to answer the following questions:

- 1. How many months exist on Mars?
- 2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
- 3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
- 4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
- 5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?

these questions are answer in the part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.
